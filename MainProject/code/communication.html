    <h1>Happy and Approachable</h1>
    <p>I am happy, unstressed and calm. <br>When I am relaxed, I am approachable and feeling unthreatened.
      <br><br>Scroll over my body to notice my signals.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="slide2" class="slides">
      <h1>Play Bow</h1>
      <p>This means I’m ready to play. I am inviting you or another dog to play with me
        and I am loose and wiggly.  I may happy bark, or playfully jump from side to side.
        Sometimes this will follow a previous play session where I may have been too rough.
        This is my way of telling you I am nonthreatening and approachable for play.
        <br><br>Scroll over my body to notice some of my other signals.</p>

    </div>

    <div id="slide3" class="slides">
      <h1>Excited/Escalated</h1>
      <p>Excited is neither a bad emotion, nor a good one. When I’m excited, I could escalate
        to being angry, overexerted, nervous, or overly happy. When this happens, I may hump,
        nip, play bite, or jump. This is a good moment to help me reset!

    </div>

    <div id="slide5" class="slides">
      <h1>Alert/Getting Information</h1>
      <p>This means I need more information. Something has caught my attention and
        I need to assess the situation more before I know how to react. If my body
        begins to shift forward and my body becomes more rigid, I may react negatively.

    </div>

    <div id="slide6" class="slides">
      <h1>Anxious/Nervous</h1>
      <p>This means I would probably like to change the environment I’m in. My eyes
        may be averting your gaze, and my body is low. I may be licking my nose,
        lifting my paw to indicate I am harmless, and angling my body away from the
        threat. At this point I am still submissive, and not going to attack. This
        would be a good time to step in and remove me from the environment if possible.

    <div id="slide7" class="slides">
      <h1>Angry/Fearful and Reactive</h1>
      <p>If I am behaving this way, I may feel like you or another dog is intruding
        on my space. If challenged, I will react. I may be snarling, growling, baring
        my teeth and my ears may be either pinned back or fully standing up. You may
        have entered my space or I am territorial over my food, toy or human. I am asking
        you to leave my environment and back down.
